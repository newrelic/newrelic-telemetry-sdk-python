    The Harvester is a thread implementation which sends data to New Relic every
    ``harvest_interval`` seconds or until the data buffers are full.

    The reporter will automatically handle error conditions which may occur
    such as:

    * Network timeouts
    * New Relic errors

    :param client: The client instance to call in order to send data.
    :type client: MetricClient or EventClient or SpanClient
    :param batch: A batch with record and flush interfaces.
    :type batch: MetricBatch or EventBatch or SpanBatch
    :param harvest_interval: (optional) The interval in seconds at which data
        will be reported. (default 5)
    :type harvest_interval: int or float

    :ivar client: The telemetry SDK client where the harvester sends data.
    :vartype client: Client
    :ivar batch: The telemetry SDK batch where data is flushed from.
    :vartype batch: MetricBatch or EventBatch or SpanBatch

    Example::

        >>> import os
        >>> license_key = os.environ.get("NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY", "")
