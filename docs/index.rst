newrelic-telemetry-sdk: Send data to New Relic!
===============================================

``newrelic-telemetry-sdk`` provides a Python library for sending data into `New Relic <https://newrelic.com>`_ using the Python `urllib3 <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io>`_ library.

The current SDK supports sending dimensional metrics to our `Metric API <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api>`_ and spans to our `Trace API <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api>`_.

Why is this cool?
-----------------

Dimensional metrics, events, and traces in New Relic! No agent required.
