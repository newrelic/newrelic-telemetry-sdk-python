A note about vulnerabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and their data.
We believe that providing coordinated disclosure by security researchers
and engaging with the security community are important means to achieve
our security goals.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project
or any of New Relic’s products or websites, we welcome and greatly
appreciate you reporting it to New Relic through
`our bug bounty program <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/information-security/report-security-vulnerabilities/>`__.

Setting Up Your Environment
---------------------------

This Open Source Software can be used in a large number of environments,
all of which have their own quirks and best practices. As such, while we
are happy to provide documentation and assistance for unmodified Open
Source Software, we cannot provide support for your specific
environment.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before we can accept a pull request, you must sign our `Contributor
Licensing Agreement <#contributor-license-agreement-cla>`__, if you have
not already done so. This grants us the right to use your code under the
same Apache 2.0 license as we use for this project in general.

Minimally, the `test suite <#testing-guidelines>`__ must pass for us to
accept a PR. Ideally, we would love it if you also added appropriate
tests if you’re implementing a feature!

Coding Style Guidelines
-----------------------

Our code base is formatted and linted with
`ruff <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>`__

Testing Guidelines
------------------

The Telemetry SDK uses `tox <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox>`__ for
testing. The repository uses doctests in `src/ <src/>`__ and tests in
`tests/ <tests/>`__.

You can run all of these tests, and verify that your code is formatted
correctly by running:

``tox -epy,lint``
